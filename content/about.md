Greetings! I am a dynamic and driven 24-year-old currently immersed in the world of Informatics at NTNU. Juggling the roles of a dedicated student, a loving parent to an amazing son, and an aspiring tech enthusiast, my journey is a blend of diverse experiences and passions.

As a student of Informatics, I am captivated by the intricate dance of data and algorithms that shape our digital landscape. My academic pursuits not only fuel my intellectual curiosity but also provide a solid foundation for my current endeavors. Beyond the classroom, I am a devoted parent to a wonderful son, cherishing the joys and challenges that parenthood brings.

Amidst this exciting journey, I've discovered my heart's resonance in various interests. Discgolf lets me combine my love for the outdoors with a hint of competitive spirit, while coding unveils the creative realm where I craft digital solutions from scratch. However, what truly sets my spirit aglow is the cherished moments spent with friends, where laughter and camaraderie intertwine to create unforgettable memories.

Presently, I am channeling my skills and enthusiasm into a thrilling project - crafting a web application for a startup company. This venture not only showcases my coding prowess but also allows me to be part of something innovative and impactful.
